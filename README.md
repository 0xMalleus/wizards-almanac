# The Wizards' Almanac

## Description

The Wizards' Almanac is an API for [Forgotten Runes](https://www.forgottenrunes.com/).

## Motivation

Inspired by [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/), The Wizards' Almanac aims to make creating for the Runiverse easier by providing a simple, easy to use API.

Web3 right now requires a lot of technical sophistication right now and we can unlock the passion and skills of the community by abstracting that complexity and lowering the barrier to create.

## Roadmap

This is very much a work in progress but the current thinking is as follows:

Planned features for v1.0.0:

- [] Wizards
- [] Souls
- [] Ponies
- [] Owner data (`/owner/:address`)

Beyond v1.0.0:

- [] GraphQL
- [] Affinity data
- [] Images for Wizard traits (props, heads, etc.)
- [] Images for Souls traits (props, heads, etc.)

## FAQ

### Is this the official API?

This is a FRWC community project. There is an API for the Forgotten Runes the site ([example](https://portal.forgottenrunes.com/api/souls/img/100)) but that's meant for internal use and isn't built for community use currently.

### I have a great idea for a feature! Where do I add a suggestion?

Feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/0xMalleus/wizards-almanac/issues) on GitHub! Suggestions welcome!

### You're doing something wrong! Where do I report a bug or problem with your design?

Same as above! Create an issue or shoot me a message on FRWC Discord.

### Isn't this some heavy duty tech for a simple API?

Honestly it would have been much easier and way faster to do the current functionality with something like [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server), however this is still very early stage.

In order to support features like ownership data and GraphQL, we'll need to have something more robust.

### Why did you use X, Y, Z coding pattern?

I'm using this as a learning opportunity to try new patterns, none of them are an explicit endorsement and most of them will likely changes to accommodate future functionality.

## Contributing

### Help is welcome

The Runiverse is a big place and there's lots of things that can be added and improved.

Feel free to contribute either code, knowledge, or suggestions. Issues tagged with [help wanted](https://github.com/0xMalleus/wizards-almanac/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) often need knowledge as much as coding help.

If you have questions about the technology feel free to open an Issue or send a DM.
